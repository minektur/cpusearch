# cpusearch
CLI utility to fuzzy search and scrape data about CPUs off cpubenchmark.net (benchmark, cores, tdp, socket, etc)

## why?
You ever go trolling ebay for used computer junk and want to understand the relative computing power of 
some device you're going to buy?  Is this random computer a good deal for the relative computing power
it has?  How much power is this system likely to consume, relative to some other one?  Or, if I wanted to upgrade
cpus for some system I have, would this one work?  How much more power would it use?  Is this slightly older
server more or less powerful than that other one there?  I'm not saying I spend a lot of time window shopping 
like this, but well, I do.

## what?
This very-hacky script google searches the cpu terms you give on the command line and then finds that on
cpubenchmarks.net.  It then scrapes a bunch of data about that cpu and prints it out in a single line.

It's not clean code, but it works.
